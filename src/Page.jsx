                It utilizes browser performance measurement tools to estimate the execution time and memory usage of algorithms.
                However, please note that due to various factors such as browser limitations and the nature of JavaScript execution,
                the results provided by this tool may not be entirely accurate or representative of real-world performance.
                Therefore, it is recommended to use this tool for educational experimentation and understanding rather than relying solely on its results for critical decision-making.
                By using this application, you agree to acknowledge the limitations of the Complexity Checker and understand that it does not provide precise or guaranteed accuracy in its analysis.
